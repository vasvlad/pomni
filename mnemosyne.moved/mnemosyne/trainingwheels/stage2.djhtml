<h2>Adding content</h2>

<p>
It's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it: just like in the previous
stage, we keep adding content to the page. Since we already have our
base template in place, all we have to do is to create more
pages like <code>stage0.djhtml</code>. Essentially, this is nothing
more than filling out the content-section, and the templating system
takes care of the rest for us.
